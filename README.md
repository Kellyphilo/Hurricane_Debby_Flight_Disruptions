Hurricane Debby

Hurricane Debby was a significant weather event that impacted the southeastern United States in early August 2024. 
Originating as Tropical Depression Four near Cuba on August 2, it intensified into a Category 1 hurricane by August 3 and made landfall along Florida’s Taylor County coast on August 5.  
The storm brought heavy rainfall, with some areas receiving up to 300mm, leading to widespread flooding, particularly in Madison and Taylor counties.  
Debby also produced damaging winds and spawned several tornadoes across the region. 

The Effect of Hurricane Debby

The hurricane had a profound effect on air travel.
On August 5, Orlando International Airport (MCO) experienced more than 20% of its departing flights canceled, while Tampa International Airport (TPA) saw cancellation rates approaching 30%.  
The disruptions extended to the East Coast; John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) reported 36 flight cancellations and 79 delays on August 5. 

Hypothesis
The adverse weather conditions associated with Hurricane Debby, particularly increased wind speeds and heavy precipitation, led to a significant rise in flight cancellations at MCO, TPA, and JFK airports during early August 2024. This suggests a direct correlation between severe weather events and operational disruptions in air travel.

Data

The flights data of airports MCO, TPA and JFK from 01.07.2024 to 31.08.2024.
The weather data of airports MCO, TPA and JFK from 01.07.2024 to 31.08.2024.

Conclusion

Flight cancellations at MCO, TPA, and JFK spiked as Hurricane Debby intensified, with the highest disruption on August 5. Strong correlations between wind speed, precipitation, and cancellations confirm severe weather’s impact on aviation. This highlights the need for better forecasting and contingency planning.
